Should've just focused on if-else blocks because that took up a majority of the time. We could have focused on doing something like a text-based RPG and then refined it the following week with functions. 

Trying to cram functions in at the end of the lesson wasn't a great idea. However, the lesson went pretty smoothly overall, and the way we covered the concepts made it more fun than just syntax.
